Template Roadmap
================

Planned TODO's:

* [ ] Finish write-up of an appendix or demo-file for all the special features
  of this template, along with copy-and-pastable examples of how various
  standard elements were done (giving rise to the overall standard look
  achieved).

* [ ] Include standard SVG diagram templates (blank + standard elements)

* [ ] Include Matplotlib styling code / settings for nicer graphing defaults

* [x] Set up dummy files for all the other sections / chapters linked from
  the template, so that it can compile out of the box. (This includes
  some dummy examples for the appendices)
  
  * [x] Stubs for chapters / etc.
  * [x] Stubs for appendix includes
  

* [x] Release the source files for PCCH-style diagrams as a HCI researcher 
  resource (perhaps to be done as a separate repo?). Plans for this are still TBC.
