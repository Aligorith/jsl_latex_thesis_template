year={2011},
month={May},
pages={691-700},
abstract={Usability concerns are often difficult to integrate into real-world software development processes. To remedy this situation, IBM research and development, partnering with Carnegie Mellon University, has begun to employ a repeatable and quantifiable usability analysis method, embodied in CogTool, in its development practice. CogTool analyzes tasks performed on an interactive system from a storyboard and a demonstration of tasks on that storyboard, and predicts the time a skilled user will take to perform those tasks. We discuss how IBM designers and UX professionals used CogTool in their existing practice for contract compliance, communication within a product team and between a product team and its customer, assigning appropriate personnel to fix customer complaints, and quantitatively assessing design ideas before a line of code is written. We then reflect on the lessons learned by both the development organizations and the researchers attempting this technology transfer from academic research to integration into real-world practice, and we point to future research to even better serve the needs of practice.},

title = {Spotting the Latest Version of a File with Old'nGray},
year = {2014}, 
doi = {10.1093/iwc/iwu018}, 
abstract ={The recent version problem relates to finding the latest version of a file to avoid reconciliation and rework resulting from editing an out of date version. To identify the most recent version, we developed a prototype, Old'nGray, which automatically grays out the icon of older versions of the file to help users ignore them and spot the latest version using perceptual rather than cognitive processes. We tested our prototype using a within-subjects design (n=60). Use of Old'nGray drastically reduced failure percentage from an average of 24% in the control condition to 4%, and retrieval time from an average of 17.68 s in the control condition to 6.56 with Old'nGray. The benefits of Old'nGray increased with folder size. Chronological sorting was used in only half of the control condition retrievals, which may explain the high failure percentage. The use of chronological sorting also resulted in additional retrieval time compared with the use of Old'nGray. When asked, 70% of the participants indicated that they would like the prototype to be integrated into their next operating system.},

% Information Foraging Theory =============

@article{PirolliCard:InformationForagingTheory,
  abstract = {Information Foraging Theory is an approach to understanding how strategies and technologies for information seeking, gathering and consumption are adapted to the flux of information in the environment. The theory assumes that people, when possible, will modify their strategies or the structure of the environment to maximize their rate of gaining valuable information. Field studies inform the theory by illustrating that people do freely structure their environments and their strategies to yield high gains in information foraging. The theory is developed by (a) adaptation (rational) analysis of information foraging problems and (b) a detailed process model (ACT-IF). The adaptation analysis develops (a) information patch models, which deal with time allocation and information filtering and enrichment activities in environments in which information is encountered in clusters (e.g. bibliographic collections), (b) information scent models which address the identification of information value from proximal cues, and (c) information diet models which address decisions about the selection and pursuit of information items. ACT-IF is developed to instantiate these rational models and to fit the moment-by-moment behavior of people interacting with complex information technology. ACT-IF is a production system in which the information scent of bibliographic stimuli is calculated by spreading activation mechanisms. Time allocation and item selection heuristics make use of information sent to select production rules in ways that maximize information foraging activities.},
